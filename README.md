# CVE-2021-41773 PoC

Proof of concept to check if hosts are vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773.

## Description (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41773)

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49.  

An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If files outside of the document root are not protected by "require all denied" these requests can succeed. Additionally this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

_The only vulnerable version is **Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49**._

## Patch

There are currently two methods:
1. Update Apache HTTP Server to a version >= 2.4.50
2. If the above is not possible, although not recommended as it doesn't guarantee a fix, edit the following in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`:
  ```xml
<!-- Vulnerable (Require all granted in '/') -->
<Directory />
	Options FollowSymLinks
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
</Directory>

<!-- Patched (Require all denied in '/') -->
<Directory />
	Options FollowSymLinks
	AllowOverride None
	Require all denied
</Directory>
```

## Usage

Use the script as follows:
```plaintext
CVE-2021-41773.py [-h] [--nosslcheck] host

Checks if an apache server is vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773.

positional arguments:
  host              ip/domain to be checked e.g. 'https://google.com/'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  --nosslcheck, -n  Do not verify ssl certificates
```
## For Bulk IPs/Domains

Use the one liner as follows:
```bash
cat hosts.txt | while read line; do python3 ./CVE-2021-41773.py http://$line; done
```
